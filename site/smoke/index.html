                A summary of my ultimate deathworld marathon run from a while ago. This video did pretty well; we put quite a bit of effort into it. The challenge itself wasn't too hard and was quite enjoyable. 2.0 changes have made this video quite outdated, but it's hopefully still a fun watch?

                    Development of the new base is going well. I recently set up batteries and circuits, and started making glass before realising the research for that is still a while away. I almost forgot to make way for the train line to continue further north; I had to move around some buildings after realising. The train lines are being less useful than I thought they would be. I guess the tradeoff is that this base will be quite hard to expand from when Py2 science comes.<br>
                    Still waiting for sulfur processing to research before I can make rubber.<br>
                    The old base is hanging on; coal is running out, so I might run a belt from the new coal patch. If it lasts long enough I might not have to.

                    Haven't played in a while due to a. specific other project., but I <span class="strikethrough">got distracted by</span> found time for this again, today.<br>
                    I've uncapped logistics science and improved research throughput a bit, but it's still mostly waiting for research. Fast inserters are a thing now, which is nice. Quartz processing 2 just researched; I've finished the molten glass part but have yet to cast it into anything because it is 02:26am. Happy new year. I've also paved some more of the base, as you can tell.<br>
                    Also, turns out, sulfur processing wasn't the only thing rubber was waiting on. I still need formamide from Biotechnology 2. God damn it.<br>
                    I'm not sure what I'll do when the image inevitably needs to expand upwards. Maybe it'll be fine discontinuous.<br>
                    Do you like the clean entry switching? I made that today, as this is the second entry. I guess the "last updated on" line doesn't really need to exist, with this system, but it looks nice.<br>
                    Load times will probably become more and more of an issue with this. Maybe I can get it to only load the image when you click to that entry, but right now it's. Fine.<br>
                    Also, arrow keys work! Isn't that nice.
