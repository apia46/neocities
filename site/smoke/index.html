                    Development of the new base is going well. I recently set up batteries and circuits, and started making glass before realising the research for that is still a while away. I almost forgot to make way for the train line to continue further north; I had to move around some buildings after realising. The train lines are being less useful than I thought they would be. I guess the tradeoff is that this base will be quite hard to expand from when Py2 science comes.<br>
                    Still waiting for sulfur processing to research before I can make rubber.<br>
                    The old base is hanging on; coal is running out, so I might run a belt from the new coal patch. If it lasts long enough I might not have to.

                    Haven't played in a while due to a. specific other project., but I <span class="strikethrough">got distracted by</span> found time for this again, today.<br>
                    I've uncapped logistics science and improved research throughput a bit, but it's still mostly waiting for research. Fast inserters are a thing now, which is nice. Quartz processing 2 just researched; I've finished the molten glass part but have yet to cast it into anything because it is 02:26am. Happy new year. I've also paved some more of the base, as you can tell.<br>
                    Also, turns out, sulfur processing wasn't the only thing rubber was waiting on. I still need formamide from Biotechnology 2. God damn it.<br>
                    I'm not sure what I'll do when the image inevitably needs to expand upwards. Maybe it'll be fine discontinuous.<br>
                    Do you like the clean entry switching? I made that today, as this is the second entry. I guess the "last updated on" line doesn't really need to exist, with this system, but it looks nice.<br>
                    Load times will probably become more and more of an issue with this. Maybe I can get it to only load the image when you click to that entry, but right now it's. Fine.<br>
                    Also, arrow keys work! Isn't that nice.

                    Just some small things. That project is still killing me. Slowly progressing towards making science from the new base. Planning on using the second seaweed recipe but it isn't researched yet.

                    Hello again. There's automation science and py1 -- except for the rubber. That's still two hours of research away. I've managed to get research to hover relatively stably around 5.5/min. This is kind of silly; I have no idea how I waited through all this last time, though I suppose a 300h playtime doesn't come from nowhere.<br>
                    Speaking of, I added a playtime count; it seemed useful. Really should've added it earlier; as it is now I'm just approximating from the production statistics.
                    I've also made js do the entries setup so I don't have to type in the same thing twice. Automation!<br>
                    Hey look this was when the asphalt texture changed! Cool.

                    Biotechnology 2 researched, rubber produced; I think I filled in that space pretty well. That's automation science and py1 both fully automated now.<br>
                    I'm not making enough acid gas yet; I'll need to set up the sulfur mine at some point. Still mostly just waiting for research, but this was a nice distraction. Or actual gameplay. It might've been the latter.<br>
                    The picture zoomed out slightly today; I hope that's not too much of an issue, but maybe if it is I can figure out some sort of transition thing.

                    Fixed steam bottleneck with more oil burners and an acetylene setup out of leftover coke. Made a sulfur mine and am planning to use it for more acid gas. Also paved the base a bit more, as you can see.<br>
                    Everything* I needed is researched now, so I should probably get on with building.

                    Hello! It's been a while. Updates broke all my yafc pages so I had to recalculate everything. I used the excuse to plan all the way to py2 science rigorously. As a result, I noticed that more throughput was needed in a few parts, so I've added a bit more tar processing and copper, which I ended up completely rebuilding as the previous design was stuck in all directions.<br>
					I've built ralesias, kicalk, tuuphras, aluminum 2 (all in the top left), and have started working on mechanical parts (middle). I've also started using trains more, which is a nice surprise.<br>
					The path ahead is long but clear.
